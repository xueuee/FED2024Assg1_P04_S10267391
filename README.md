FED Assignment 1
For this assignment, I will be making a revamped version of a pastry brand's website

## Design Process
This website will have an enhanced visual appeal to provide a much more plesant viewing experience to customers interested in buying pastries from the brand.

- As a customer, I want to view the pastry company's menu so I would know they are offering and where to visit the physical store locations or know how to contact the company if I am interested in purchasing from them.

## Features
There will be a total of 4 newly revamped pages to this website

### Existing Features
- TBA

### Features Left to Implement
- Home page - Displays Popular/Featured/Limited edition items
- Menu - Showcases the different types of cakes and pastries being sold
- About - Information about the company's goal and history
- Stores & Contact - Store locations & contact information

## Technologies Used
(In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.)

- HTML
- CSS

## Testing (WIP)
(For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:)

Contact form:
- Go to the "Contact Us" page
- Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about - the required fields appears
- Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
- Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

(In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.)

(You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.)
