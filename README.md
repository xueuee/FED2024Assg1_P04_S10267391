FED Assignment 1
- For this assignment, I will be making a revamped menu website for Chateraise, a pastry brand.

## Design Process
This website will have an enhanced visual appeal to provide a much more plesant viewing experience to customers interested in buying pastries from Chateriase.

- As a customer, I want to view the pastry company's menu so I would know they are offering, where to visit the physical store locations or know how to contact the company if I am interested in purchasing from them, and learn more about the company's goal and history.
